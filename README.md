Steps to open the HTML based API for the computation of the magnetic force between two cylindrical permanent magnets:

1. Download all the files and unzip in a folder visible to Python (your current working directory);
2. Install the required softwares with the preferred versions (this may work on other versions, but need to try) listed in the requirements.txt;
3. Execute command python main.py;
4. Copy the local host IP address (for example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/) on a browser such as Chrome;
5. Enjoy the state-of-the-art way which is fast and accurate to compute the magnetic force between permanent magnets using a deep learning based data-driven model;
6. Please cite the paper: Van Tai Nguyen, Michael Birmingham and Matthew Dargusch, "Data â€“ Driven Modelling of the Interaction Force between Permanent Magnets" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2021.167869 on your project, publications!
